# Model Evaluation with Cross-Validation and Random Forest

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on evaluating machine learning models using cross-validation techniques. Random Forest is used as an ensemble learning method and evaluated using K-Fold and Stratified K-Fold cross-validation. The performance of Random Forest is compared with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree classifiers.
